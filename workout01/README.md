Stat 133 Workout 1: GSW Shot Charts

This homework is about analyzing shot data of five Golden State Warriors players during the 2016-2017 NBA season. We filter the original dataset that was provided to us and create shot-charts for each player, and also see the overall number of 2 point and 3 point shots made per player in tables. We then summarise our findings in the form of a report, in order to analyze the shot history of these well-known players. Overall, we want to see the number of shots and effective shooting percentages of these five players, and also see where they typically shoot from on the court, to analyze their performance history.
