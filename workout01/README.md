Stat 133: Workout 1 

This homework is about analyzing shot data of five Golden State Warrior players during the 2016-2017 season. We filter the original dataset and create shot-charts for each player, and also see the overall number of 2 point and 3 point shots made per player in tables. We then summarise our findings in the form of a report, in order to analyze the shot history of these well-known players.
