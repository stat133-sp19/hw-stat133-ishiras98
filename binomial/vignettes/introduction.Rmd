## Binomial Experiment

The package `"binomial"` intends to simulate a binomial experiment and create a distribution of probabilities associated with a certain number of successes in the experiment. To create this and extract properties of such distributions, we need related calculations such as the expected value and variance. 

## Function - bin_choose()

The first step is to create a function `bin_choose()`, in order to find the choose factor associated with the formula for binomial probability. This choose factor uses factorials to compute the number of ways in which there can be 'k' successes in 'n' trials. Hence, the arguments of the function are *'n'* and *'k'*, where n and k have to be numeric values and whole numbers. In addition, 'k' can be a vector of successes of length greater than 1.

Here are some examples of how to invoke the function `bin_choose()`: 

```{r}
bin_choose(n = 5, k = 2)
bin_choose(5, 0)
bin_choose(5, 1:3)
```

## Function - bin_probability()

The next step is to create a function `bin_probability()` in order to find the probability of getting 'k' successes in 'n' trials. Hence, the arguments of the function are *success*, *trials*, and *prob*, where *prob* is refers to the probability of success. 

Here are some examples of how to invoke the function `bin_probability()`:

```{r}
# probability of getting 2 successes in 5 trials
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)

# probabilities of getting 2 or less successes in 5 trials
# (assuming prob of success = 0.5)
bin_probability(success = 0:2, trials = 5, prob = 0.5)

# 55 heads in 100 tosses of a loaded coin with 45% chance of heads
bin_probability(success = 55, trials = 100, prob = 0.45)
```

## Function- bin_distribution()

Once the choose factor and associated probability have been calculated, the binomial probability formula is complete. `bin_distribution()` is a function which outputs a data frame of the binomial probability associated with each number of successes. The data frame has two classes: 'bindis' and 'data.frame'. The arguments of this function are *trials* and *prob*, but this function relies on the previous function, `bin_probability()` in order to calculate respective binomial probabilities. 

Here are some examples of how to invoke the function `bin_distribution()`: 
```{r}
# binomial cumulative distribution
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

The function `plot.bindis()` can also be used in conjunction with `bin_distribution()`. It outputs a barplot with number of successes on the x axis and binomial probability on the y axis. 

Here is an example of how to use *plot* in order to obtain a probability histogram using data from the data frame which was created by using `bin_distribution()`:

```{r}
# plotting binomial probability distribution
dis1 <- bin_distribution(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis1)
```

## Function- bin_cumulative()

The function `bin_cumulative()` computes both the probability distribution and cumulative probabilities of an experiment. It returns a data frame with two classes: 'bincum' and 'data.frame', where number of successes is in the first column, binomial probabilities are in the second column, and cumulative probabilites are in the third column. The arguments of `bin_cumulative()` are *trials*, and *prob*, though this function also relies on `bin_probability()`. 

Here are some examples of how to invoke the function `bin_cumulative()`:

```{r}
# binomial cumulative distribution
bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
```

The function `plot.bincum()` can also be used in conjunction with `bin_cumulative`. It outputs a line plot with number of successes on the x axis and cumulative probability on the y axis. 

Here is an example of how to use *plot* in order to obtain a line plot using data from the data frame created by using `bin_cumulative()`:

```{r}
# plotting binomial cumulative distribution
dis2 <- bin_cumulative(trials = 5, prob = 0.5)
plot(dis2)
```

## Function= bin_variable()

The function `bin_variable()` returns a list (of class "binvar") of named elements. The list should include the number of trials and probability of success. Hence, `bin_variable()` has *trials* and *prob* as its arguments.

The method function `print.binvar()` neatly prints the content of the object of class "binvar"

Here is an example of how you to invoke the function `bin_variable()`:

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
bin1
```

The method function `summary.binvar()` displays a full summary of the object with class "binvar".

Finally, the print method function `print.summary.binvar()` neatly  prints the contents of the object with class "summary.binvar".

Here is an example of how to output a summary using the main function `bin_variable()`: 

```{r}
bin1 <- bin_variable(trials = 10, p = 0.3)
binsum1 <- summary(bin1)
binsum1
```

## Functions of measures

These are main functions that have *trials* and *prob* as their arguments. After checking that the inputted arguments are valid, they calculate their respective measures: mean, variance, mode, skewness, and kurtosis of the binomial distribution. 

Here are some examples of how to invoke the measure functions:

```{r}
bin_mean(10, 0.3)
bin_variance(10, 0.3)
bin_mode(10, 0.3)
bin_skewness(10, 0.3)
bin_kurtosis(10, 0.3)
```
